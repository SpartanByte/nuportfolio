        <h3>CSS</h3>
        <p>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is a stylesheet language used for styling colors, fonts, placement, layouts, and other necessities required for making beautiful websites. Many developers still use "straight" CSS and implement the new features that come when versions update, which is now on CSS3. There are also CSS preprocessors, sometimes called frameworks or libraries, such as SASS and Less. It's also become common for frameworks to mix prewritten CSS with Javascript, which is where Bootstrap, a now common framework, came from. There are other front end frameworks spawning and testing such as Modernizer and Pure. Modernizer mimics the Bootstrap framework but is much more lightweight. However, each developer always has their preference and style for CSS just as they do with "backend" programming.</p>
