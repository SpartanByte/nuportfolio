        <h1>A Brief Story About Myself</h1>

        <!-- start of background/bio -->
        <h3>Background</h3>
        <hr />
            <p>I am a native of Fargo, North Dakota and attended Fargo North High School. I chose Web Development as a career path for many reason. I'm really captivated by the vastly different roles and hats as well as the different tools, technologies, environments and the list goes on. I have a vigourous creative side, enjoying Adobe Photoshop, Photography, vector graphics, User Interface/User Experience (UI/UX) Design.

        <h3>Front-End</h3>
        <hr />
            <p>I'm fascinated by the ever changing trends and standards in layouts and I'm always looking for the "WOW" factor. I love CSS transitions, animations, and many more of the tools that are growing and expanding for stylesheets. </p>

        <h3>Back-End</h3>
        <hr />
            <p>A more logical side that's fascinated with functionality and solutions has magnetized itself on the backend as well.</p>
