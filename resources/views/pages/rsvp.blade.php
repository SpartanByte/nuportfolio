            <span style="color:red"><strong>Regarding COVID-19 (Updated: 03/22/2020)</strong><br>
				We are heartbroken to say that, due to COVID-19 and health issues, we will most likely have to postpone our wedding ceremony and reception. There is no way to tell when state restrictions regarding social distancing and against congregating will be lifted. As you know, this is one of many events being postponed (concerts, sporting events, etc included). However, we will be rescheduling as it is something that we've invested a lot of time and resources in, not to mention wanting to share it with all of you. We will still likely wed on May 1st in a bare minimum ceremony. We will be treating the rescheduled ceremony as if it was day zero as we would've had we not had to reschedule this. When a date is set, we will make sure each and every one of you know. It will likely be in the same location. Thank you for your understanding and we want you all to stay safe.</span><br>
			<h2>Older Updates</h2>
            <p>You're invited to join us in a celebration of marriage, handfasting, and the holiday of Beltane. The ceremony is scheduled for May 01, 2020 at 6:00 pm at Unitarian Universalist Church in Fargo, North Dakota. After the ceremony, there will be a reception in the basement with catering courtesy of <a href="https://spitfirebarandgrill.com/menu/" target="_blank">Spitfire Bar & Grill</a>. We hope that you will come celebrate with us and we have the chance to talk with each of you. We have set up two Google Forms, buttons below. If you are unable to attend, we understand. For some, it was unlikely that you are going to be able to attend, we still sent out invitations so that you know we thought of you. For those of you who can attend, there are some catering questions along with the RSVP. You are not chosing your meal, we are simply getting a general idea of which foods we should get more (or less) quantities of. Thank you, in advance, for taking the time to fill out the form that applies to you. Thinking of you always.</p>

            <h4>Information Update (March 1st, 2020)</h4>
            <p>We would like to state that dress code, or what would be for most weddings, is not set. It is more important to the two of us that friends, family, and loved ones can celebrate with us than then what others are dressed in. In the same regard, if anyone enjoys dressing up a little (as we will be), feel free to do so. If you would like to dress casual, dress casual. If you would like to dress up, dress up. You’re all wonderful people and we are excited for you to attend, if it is what time and circumstances allow.</p>
			<p>Also, we realize that most of you are likely unfamiliar with handfasting. It’s an ancient Celtic and Pagan tradition, dating back to the fifth century. It is where the expression “typing the knot” originated. <a href="https://www.brides.com/story/handfasting-wedding-ceremony-101" target="_blank">Bride.come as a great article</a> and brief introduction to handfasting.</p>

            <p>Also, if there is any future information or updates, they will appear on this page as well. Thank you all again!</p>
